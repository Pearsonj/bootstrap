            <p>Hello! My name is a Joshua Pearson and I am 25 years old. I love to travel and spend time with family and friends as well as play the occasional video game or two. I am originally born in Kirkland, Washington and soon after that my mother and I moved to Oregon City, Oregon where I grew up and lived till about 20 years old when I moved to Southern Oregon. I spent most of my time working in kitchens and doing other odd jobs here and there.</p>
            <p>Ive always been interested in working in the tech field, but I never really had much of an opportunity to go to school so I self taught some basic HTML and css stuff and just a little javascript. Now I am attending the University of Washington's Coding Bootcamp to propel myself into the world of tech to pursue a career that I have always wanted. This is an exciting step in the right direction and I can't wait to see where it takes me in the future!</p>
